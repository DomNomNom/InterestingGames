================

A list of games that are noteworthy.

I mainly asses in terms of game mechanics.

    + minimalistic 2D boss battle
    + power (multijump/attack power) is contained in blocks. blocks can be gathered to become more powerful. blocks are ejected when spending power.
    + adaptive music to power
    + nice alternative ending.

   + Moving behaviours between enemies and player character.
     This is a interesting tradeoff between player ability and getting things to do what you want. 
     An example of this would be the player sacrificing their ability to move to make a impassable rock walk to the side


* [The Sea Has No Claim](http://dukope.com/play.php?g=sea)

    + 1-bit (two color) graphics style
    + Figuring out ship positions from several different methods of partially detecting ship locations.

* [Lonely Boy]()

    + The outline-only style where only what is neccesary to the experience is drawn. A blend between astetic and game mechanic!
    + It feels like a game equivalent of a written short storey.
